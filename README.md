# turtlebot4_factory_inspection
This repository contains a ROS 2-based autonomous factory inspection system implemented on TurtleBot4 using BehaviorTree.CPP.The robot autonomously follows predefined waypoints, performs angle-aligned photo capturing, avoids obstacles, and returns to its base.Captured images are saved and analyzed to detect changes compared to previous inspections, enabling long-term monitoring of factory environments.The system is developed using a modular C++ behavior tree structure and follows a bottom-up, Agile-style implementation process.
