# ü§ñ turtlebot4_factory_inspection
  This repository contains a ROS 2-based autonomous factory inspection system implemented on TurtleBot4 using BehaviorTree.CPP.     
  The robot autonomously follows predefined waypoints, performs angle-aligned photo capturing, avoids obstacles, and returns to its base.     
  Captured images are saved and analyzed to detect changes compared to previous inspections, enabling long-term monitoring of factory environments.       
  The system is developed using a modular C++ behavior tree structure and follows a bottom-up, Agile-style implementation process.
